### 

Dear Harithra,
I know you said a letter is enough, but I wanted to take a moment to express how much you mean to me.
And you know that my handwriting is terrible, so I thought this would be a better way to share my feelings.
Thank you for being more than just my sister you're my built-in best friend, therapist.
I’ll protect you from weird people, bad vibes, and whatever life throws at you. 
And if anyone messes with you, they’ll have me to deal with (and yes, that’s a serious threat).
            
You are the most amazing person I know, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. 
Your strength, kindness, and sense of humor make every day brighter.
I just miss the days we spend together.

Love you,  
**– \,
Your brother Abinand(who’s definitely cooler than you, but don’t tell anyone) 😎**
